# Amino Acid Classification Quiz (day05)

This is a simple terminal-based game for practicing amino acid properties
for a Python course assignment.

The game randomly shows you amino acids and asks you to classify them by:
- **charge** (positive / negative / neutral)
- **polarity** (polar / nonpolar)
- **aromaticity** (aromatic / non-aromatic)

You choose which category you want to practice and how many questions to answer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (no external dependencies required for the game itself)
- (Optional) `pytest` for running the tests

To install `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
